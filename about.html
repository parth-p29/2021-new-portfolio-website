                <p>
                    Hi, my name is Parth Patel and I'm currently pursing a degree in Systems Design Engineering
                    at UWaterloo. Growing up, I was always fascinated by how things worked.
                    Specifically, video games and Websites, I always wondered what it took to build such systems and thus I set out a path
                    to study Engineering and learn just that!

                </p>
          
                <p>
                    I would like to think I have a special knack for picking up things quickly and have a deep fondness for learning.
                    I aim to build software that actually solve problems people face. As such, through my internship at Ceridian and various
                    meaningful projects I have developed, I wish to continue walking down this path and helping people in any way that I can.

                </p>
          
                <p>
                    Outside of coding, I enjoy playing sports like 🏀 and ⚽, Working out (look out for my muscle-up video), 
                    learning about space/stargazing and writing!
                </p>
